# 6th-Grade-Digital-Forensics-Project

This was a project I did with 6th graders during a 4 week mini unit this year on file carving a corrupted hard drive using file signatures and Python.  Project 1 was an introduction into finding png/jpg/pdf files using a Python file I provided them, and project 2 was to automate the process given a starter Python file.  Some files were normal, and some were obfuscated to make it more challenging.
